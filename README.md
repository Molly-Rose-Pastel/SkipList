# SkipList
performance improvement of a linked list using a skiplist extension

In this project we had to implement mergesort, quicksort and heapsort on a linked list. 
Quicksort and heapsort do not work very well on linked lists as they require random access to elements which linked list do not provide.
Instead you have to iterate over the list until you reach the element you want to access, which uses a lot of performance.
The idea was to use a skip list module to decrease the iteration time and see how it will affect performance.
